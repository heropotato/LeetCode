    * Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
    *
    * Given a binary tree
    *
    *
    * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
    *
    * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
    *
    * Note:
    *
    *
    * You may only use constant extra space.
    * You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).
    * For example,
    *
    * Given the following perfect binary tree,
    *
    *       1
    *     /  \
    *    2    3
    *   / \  / \
    *  4  5  6  7
    *
    * After calling your function, the tree should look like:
    *
    *       1 -> NULL
    *     /  \
    *    2 -> 3 -> NULL
    *   / \  / \
    *  4->5->6->7 -> NULL
    *
    *
