* Jump Game II
*
* Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
*
* Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
*
* Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
*
*
* For example:
* Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]
*
* The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)
