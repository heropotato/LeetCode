### Essential classes
Two essential java classes have been pre-defined(`ListNode`, `TreeNode`, `Interval`, `TreeLinkNode`, `UndirectedGraphNode`, and `RandomListNode`):

* `ListNode`: definition for singly linked list.
* `TreeNode`: definition for binary tree.
* `Interval`: definition for interval.
* `TreeLinkNode`: definition for binary tree with next point.
* `UndirectedGraphNode`: definition for undirected graph.
* `RandomListNode`: definition for singly-linked list with a random pointer.

### Naming references
Each class is called a name, standing for easy-to-find, which is exactly same against names on [LeetCode Online Judge][].
