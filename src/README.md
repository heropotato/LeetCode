### Essential classes
Seven essential java classes have been predefined (`ListNode`, `TreeNode`, `Interval`, `TreeLinkNode`, `UndirectedGraphNode`, `RandomListNode` and `Point`):

* `ListNode`: definition for singly-linked list.
* `TreeNode`: definition for binary tree.
* `Interval`: definition for an interval.
* `TreeLinkNode`: definition for binary tree with next point.
* `UndirectedGraphNode`: definition for undirected graph.
* `RandomListNode`: definition for singly-linked list with a random pointer.
* `Point`: definition for a point.

### Naming references
Each solution (class) is called a name against [LeetCode Online Judge][] rather than the default "Solution" for easy-to-find purposes.
